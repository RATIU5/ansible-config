# RATIU5 ansible-config

This is my main ansible script for setting up my environment. Works the same on MacOS, Linux, and Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Install

Run the following to download the installation script on your system. It will download and install Homebrew if on MacOS or use `apt` if on Linux to install Ansible.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RATIU5/ansible-config/main/install.sh | bash
```
